# Autonomous Car

## Project Description
The ultimate goal of this project was to apply the agile scrum method.
The project consists in developing (in Python 3) a mobile module in order to carry out a race of
formula 1 on a circuit defined by the teachers.
• The module will be able to perform at least one complete lap of the circuit (this one can
be timed in order to define the position on the starting grid of the race).
• He must be able to stop after the finish line.
• It will be possible to define the number of laps to complete for a race (the number of laps
will be drawn at random by the teachers)
• He must be able to avoid any obstacle (eg walls, other vehicles, etc.)
• It will be necessary to make sure to optimize the trajectories of the module as much as possible in order to
obviously, winning the race.

## Equipment provided
The module will be equipped with various sensors and motors such as:
• HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors
• An infrared sensor
• Two DC motors
• 3 servomotors, two of which are optional
You will have the following equipment available:
• A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (you will need to establish an SSH connection / TightVNCserver
with this one)
• A 2.4A AC/DC power supply
• Four 18650 type batteries of 5800mAh each
• A charger for 18650 battery.
• A µSD card (blank – you will therefore need to install the Raspbian OS)
• A SunFounder Module (smart video car kit) already mounted.
• You can, if necessary, benefit from additional equipment.
